saketini





f wasabi mashed potatoes—the nineties anachronism that cleaved a  sushi-tray condiment to a staple American side—has a liquid equivalent  it would be the saketini. The drink married two once raging, now faded  trends: Asian fusion cuisine and the bastardization of martinis  (remember bright green appletinis and their neon-hued ilk?). Asian  fusion food, as has been recounted ad nauseam, reemerged under  different, less dated terminology to become one of the contemporary  cooking’s biggest influences. Asian-inspired cocktails, however, saw no  such world-dominating comeback. While chefs in trend-setting restaurants all over the globe were folding miso into butter and teasing out umami  depths in broth with dashi, bartenders were mining pre-Prohibition  American cocktail books, boosting whiskey, gin, and bitters, not  anything out of the Far East kitchen.
